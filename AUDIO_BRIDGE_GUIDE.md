# USB Headset + SIM800 Audio Bridge Setup Guide

## Why USB Headset Isn't Working

Your USB headset is connected to your computer's audio system, but the SIM800 module has its own separate audio system. Setting the headset as "default" only affects computer audio, not the SIM800's audio.

## Immediate Solution: Use SIM800 Built-in Audio

1. **Make a call** using the dialer interface
2. **Speak close to the SIM800 module** (it has a built-in microphone)
3. **Listen to the SIM800's small speaker** on the module
4. This works immediately without any additional hardware

## Complete Solution: Hardware Audio Bridge

To route audio between SIM800 and USB headset, you need:

### Required Hardware:
- 2x 3.5mm audio cables (male-to-male)
- Computer with separate audio input/output jacks
- OR USB audio adapter with input/output

### Connection Steps:
1. **SIM800 Audio Output** → **Computer Audio Input** (microphone jack)
2. **Computer Audio Output** → **SIM800 Audio Input** (headphone jack)

### Windows Audio Configuration:
1. Right-click sound icon → "Open Sound settings"
2. **Output**: Set USB headset as default
3. **Input**: Set USB headset microphone as default
4. Go to Recording devices → Select "Microphone" → Properties
5. **"Listen" tab** → Check "Listen to this device"
6. **Levels tab** → Adjust microphone boost if needed

### Test the Setup:
1. Make a call with the dialer
2. Audio flow: **Caller** ↔ **SIM800** ↔ **Computer** ↔ **USB Headset**

## Which Solution Should You Use?

- **Quick test**: Use SIM800 built-in audio first
- **Professional use**: Get audio cables for USB headset integration

Would you like to test the SIM800 built-in audio first, or do you want to get the hardware for USB headset integration?
